## <a id="features"></a> ✨ Features
* ✔ **Real Boggle Dice**
  * Uses the official 16 Hasbro Boggle dice with **Fisher-Yates Shuffle** algorithm.
* ✔ **Smart Path Validation**
  * **Adjacency Check**: Ensures letters are neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
  * **Non-reuse**: Prevents using the same die twice in a single word.
  * **Dictionary Check**: Validates words against a loaded English dictionary (`dictionary-yawl.txt`) using efficient **Set** lookups ($O(1)$ complexity).
* ✔ **Persistent High Score**
  * Uses `localStorage` to save your highest score locally, keeping the challenge alive even after refreshing the page.
* ✔ **Real-Time Feedback**
  * **Timer**: A countdown timer derived from `Date` objects for accuracy.
  * **Live Clock**: Displays current real-world time.
  * **Status Messages**: Non-intrusive alerts for errors (e.g., "Not adjacent", "Word not found").
* ✔ **Automatic Scoring**
  * Scores are based on classic Boggle rules:
    | Word Length | Points |
    | :--- | :--- |
    | 3-4 letters | 1 |
    | 5 letters | 2 |
    | 6 letters | 3 |
    | 7 letters | 5 |
    | 8+ letters | 11 |
